Entrepreneurs struggle to find the right resources, support or business connections when they need it. Mostly this is due to a fragmented & confusing support ecosystem, with the user not having the social capital within that ecosystem. Lack of connections is part of the reason 90% of entrepreneurs fail.

This ‘Recommendation Engine’ app will sit at the heart of the Ecosystem Connect, easily and quickly, with continuous updates, connecting the user to support applicable to their needs.

In This, We have created an app enabling users to enter a query of the support they require into the Ecosystem Connect search bar.  AI is used to search the internet & our SQL knowledge for the most appropriate resource/support to their request, locally & nationwide. The user can select a region to narrow down the search. The default region is W Midlands. 

The search results are returned & displayed as ‘Additional Support’. Organisations identified as having Preferred Partner status will be displayed above the Additional Support organisations. Preferred Partner details will be larger & more favourably displayed.

I have created the Ecosystem Connect backend, including the AI element. This includes web scraping, LLM, cleaning the data, creating the SQL database, and Flask/Fast API integration.

All the Files and content required to build the Task are attached for reference.
